## Why Did I Start This Project on Chocolatey?

> Efficient and quick software installation on Windows for my new projects.

I had already experimented with tools like Vercel for my portfolio, appreciating the automation and simplicity they brought.

However, when setting up new Windows/MacOs machines, the tedious repetition of manual software installation became evident.

This is where Chocolatey came into play, offering an elegant and automated solution for this process.

## The Basics of Chocolatey
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows, inspired by package managers found in systems like Linux.

It allows for the installation, updating, and management of software on a Windows machine using simple commands in the command prompt or PowerShell.

```batch showLineNumbers {1-3}
choco install <pkg|packages.config> [<pkg2> <pkgN>] [<options/switches>]
choco upgrade <pkg|all> [<pkg2> <pkgN>] [<options/switches>]
choco uninstall <pkg|all> [pkg2 pkgN] [options/switches]
```
*Find more in [chocolatey documentation](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/)*

## Configuration and Usage

To fully leverage Chocolatey, I had to configure certain aspects of my Windows machine and understand how to use Chocolatey to effectively manage software installations.

```batch showLineNumbers {3}
:: Check if .NET Framework 4.8 or higher is installed
echo Checking for .NET Framework 4.8 or higher...
REG QUERY "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full" /v Release > nul 2>&1
IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 (
    FOR /F "tokens=3" %%G IN ('REG QUERY "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full" /v Release') DO SET "dotNetVersion=%%G"
    IF !dotNetVersion! GEQ %minReleaseNumber% (
        echo .NET Framework 4.8 or later is installed.
    ) ELSE (
        echo .NET Framework 4.8 or later is not installed.
        goto InstallError
    )
) ELSE (
    echo Unable to determine the .NET Framework version installed.
    goto InstallError
)
```
```batch showLineNumbers {3, 11}
:: Install Chocolatey
echo Installing Chocolatey...
powershell.exe -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"
if errorlevel 1 goto InstallError

:: Define the chocolatey executable
SET "choco=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\choco.exe"

:: Check if Chocolatey is installed
echo Checking for Chocolatey installation...
%choco% --version > nul 2>&1
IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    echo Chocolatey is not installed. Please install it first.
    goto InstallError
)
```

## Integration with My Workflows

Integrating Chocolatey into my development workflows has been a game changer.

Not only has it simplified the setup of new development environments, but it has also offered consistency and reproducibility in managing software across different machines.

In one of my assignments, I had already faced internal custom installation tools to have a similar configuration for all developers.
The problem was that the environment variables were not generated, software was not necessarily installed in the right place, etc.

I am convinced that Chocolatey can solve many of the encountered problems as it is inspired by the official installer of each application.

## Advantages and Limitations
Using Chocolatey, I have noticed significant gains in terms of time and efficiency. However, it is important to note some limitations and considerations, especially regarding the availability of packages and security.

## Conclusion
With Chocolatey, I have been able to transform a repetitive and tedious aspect of development under Windows into a simple and automated process. This has not only sped up the setup of new projects but has also added a welcome level of standardization to my development environments.

If you are a developer working on Windows and looking to streamline your software installation process, I encourage you to explore Chocolatey. You will find more details and script examples in the documentation on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Fyleek/chocolatey).
