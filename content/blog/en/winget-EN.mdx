## Why did I start this project with WinGet?

> Efficient and fast software installation on Windows for my new projects.

I had already experimented with tools like Vercel for my portfolio, enjoying the automation and simplicity they offered.

Previously, I used **Chocolatey** to automate software installation on Windows. But with the arrival of **WinGet** (which I didn't know about at the time), the official package manager from Microsoft, everything changed.

Since it no longer requires third-party installation, is native, and better integrated into the system, **WinGet** quickly became the obvious solution to simplify my software installation process.

## The basics of WinGet

**WinGet** is a command-line package manager for Windows, directly inspired by Linux package managers.

It allows you to install, update, and uninstall applications in a simple and automated way via PowerShell or Command Prompt.

```powershell showLineNumbers {1-4}
# Install a package
winget install <package_identifier>

# Update a package
winget upgrade <package_identifier>

# Uninstall a package
winget uninstall <package_identifier>
```

*Find more in the [winget documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)*

## Configuration and Usage

To fully leverage **WinGet**, I updated my scripts to use this new tool.

The only prerequisite is to have **Windows 10 (1809+)** or **Windows 11**, with the "App Installer" application (usually pre-installed).

Here’s an example of checking and automating software installation:

```powershell showLineNumbers {3}
# Check that winget is installed
winget --version

# Example of installing multiple applications
winget install --id=Google.Chrome --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements
winget install --id=Microsoft.VisualStudioCode --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements
winget install --id=Docker.DockerDesktop --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements
```

And to keep my software up to date:

```powershell showLineNumbers {1}
# Update all installed applications
winget upgrade --all --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements
```

## Integration with my workflows

Integrating **WinGet** into my development workflows was seamless.

It simplified the setup of new environments while providing consistency and reproducibility.

In a past project, I encountered internal installation scripts where environment variables were not generated correctly, and software was installed in different locations depending on the machine...

With **WinGet**, these issues are much less frequent since the tool relies on official installers and follows best installation practices.

## Advantages and Limitations

By using **WinGet**, I’ve seen significant improvements in productivity and simplicity.

Advantages:

* Native Windows package manager (no third-party installation),
* Enhanced security (official Microsoft Community Package Manifest Repository source),
* Ease of use,
* Easy automation.

Limitations:

* Some specific software is still not available in the catalog,
* Some installers still require manual interaction.

## Conclusion

With **WinGet**, I’ve modernized my software installation and maintenance processes on Windows.

No more heavy scripts or tedious manual installations: a few commands are now enough to set up a new working environment.

If you are a Windows developer looking to streamline your software management, I encourage you to explore **WinGet**.
