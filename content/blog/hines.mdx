In May 2021, I joined the application development team at Hines —one of the largest privately held real estate investors and managers in the world. Our team is responsible for building a suite of applications that help Hines manage its $81.7B Portfolio of Assets Under Management, serving 27 countries worldwide, and doing so successfully for over 64 years.

## Transforming the industry

At Hines, we believe strongly in pushing the boundaries to shape the future and build a better world by getting into a state of mind of innovation. It is a goal to transform the real estate industry by placing innovation at the very core of the company.

What differentiates Hines is a tailored approach to global real estate investing. We continue to evaluate and incorporate new technologies, as opposed to only using cookie-cutter solutions. Best said by the company’s founder:

> I believe we can always improve, either by rethinking existing ways of doing things, or by thinking outside the box. This is innovation. –Gerald D. Hines

By going the Django way we can use a classical MVT (Model View Template) approach to build our applications, and create robust and scalable applications that are easy to maintain and extend.
