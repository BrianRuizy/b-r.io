I've already created a video covering my desk setup, if you wish watch that instead click the card link down below. But I wanted to create a blog post to go along with it for those that prefer a quick read for all the links and resources that make up my desk setup. So here you go!

To provide some background, I'm currently a Software Engineer by day and part time creator in the evenings. I spend tons of hours on my desk coding, editing photos or videos and learning new things. So I've put together a desk setup that allows me to be productive in both of these areas.

## The Desk

First thing first is the desk, which is the centerpiece of a setup. I've had the privilege of testing the [Ergonofis Sway Desk](https://shrsl.com/49346), which was gifted to me. It's a game-changer, with a really slick control interface. Plus, it's got the aesthetics to match its functionality. They even thought about implementing an anti-collision system, preventing desk-related mishaps.

The Ergonofis team also sent me their solid wood monitor riser / desk shelf. It's a pretty known and accepted notion that having your monitor at eye level is the best for your posture. So this desk shelf is a great way to do that. It's also a great way to add some style to your desk setup.

## Monitors and Lighting

A high-quality monitor is a must for my work, and I've chosen the LG 34WN780. Its ergonomic stand offers complete control over screen positioning, allowing me to customize my view. Additionally, I've incorporated the BenQ Screen Bar Halo, a USB-powered lamp that provides consistent and glare-free illumination for my workspace.

## Computer Setup

My primary workhorse is the 16-inch MacBook Pro, a reliable and powerful companion. To streamline my connections and reduce cable clutter, I use an Anker USB-C hub. This setup allows me to focus on my work without distractions. For a superb audio experience, I turn to the AirPods Max, which provide exceptional sound quality and help me maintain my productivity.
